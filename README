NAME
	passcheck - passphrase strength evaluator

SYNOPSIS
	passcheck [OPTION]... < PASSPHRASE_LIST

DESCRIPTION
	Evaluates the strength of passphrases based.
	All passphrases are given a non-negative integer rating.

	The output is formatted so that it is suitable for
	piping into 'sort -rn' to sort passphrases by strength.

	300 is a good threshold for strong passphrases,
	200 is a good threshold for acceptable passphrases.

OPTIONS
	-r
	--raw
		Treat escape sequences as part of the passphrases.
		If not used, ANSI escape sequences are ignored.

	-w
	--waste-ram
		Loads the blacklist into RAM and creates a hash set
		of it. It is unreasonable to do this unless you have
		the process running indefinitely and (somewhat)
		continuously feed passphrases. Note that this
		requires a lot of RAM.

RATIONALE
	Passphrase-strength meters used on the Web use horrid
	heuristics and does not even blacklist the most common
	passphrases. We need better passphrase-strength meters
	to keep users safe.

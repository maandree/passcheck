passcheck is a tool that rates passphrases based on the strengths,
a highly rated passphrase is a string passphrase.

Personally I suggest not using any passphrases rated below 250.

The program parses each line (must end exactly with one UNIX line break)
as a password and puts the (positive integer) rating before the passphrase
seperated with one blankspace.

The program supports colour in the passphrase and ignores them unless
--raw (or -r) is used as an option. This is done because colours cannot
be copied from any regular terminal.

Passphrases are read from stdin and the rating followed by the passphrase
for each passphrases is written t stdout, and stderr is quited unless the
program files.

You may want to pipe stdout to `sort -n` to get the strongest passphrase
at the buttom.

Currently, evaluation based on grammar is not made, so please manually
change that the passphrase you choose does not form a grammatically
correct sentence, and perferablly, not even in part.
